    "The four pillars of object-oriented programming (OOP) are:\n",

    "</br>\n",
    "Encapsulation refers to the bundling of data (attributes) and methods (behaviors) that operate on that data into a single unit called a class.\n",
    "It hides the internal state of objects from the outside world and restricts direct access to data, allowing access only through well-defined interfaces (methods).\n",
    "Encapsulation helps achieve data abstraction, modularity, and information hiding, enhancing the security and maintainability of code.\n",
    "</br>\n",
    "Inheritance:\n",
    "</br>\n",
    "Inheritance is the mechanism by which a class (subclass or derived class) inherits properties and behaviors from another class (superclass or base class).\n",
    "It allows the creation of a hierarchy of classes, where subclasses can reuse and extend the attributes and methods of their superclass.\n",
    "Inheritance promotes code reuse, modularity, and the organization of classes into logical hierarchies, facilitating the implementation of the \"is-a\" relationship.\n",
    "</br>\n",
    "Polymorphism:\n",
    "</br>\n",
    "Polymorphism refers to the ability of objects to take on multiple forms or behaviors based on the context in which they are used.\n",
    "It allows objects of different classes to be treated as objects of a common superclass, enabling generic programming and method overriding.\n",
    "Polymorphism is achieved through method overloading (compile-time polymorphism) and method overriding (run-time polymorphism), allowing flexibility and extensibility in code design.\n",
    "</br>\n",
    "Abstraction:\n",
    "</br>\n",
    "Abstraction is the process of simplifying complex systems by modeling the relevant aspects and ignoring unnecessary details.\n",
    "It allows the creation of abstract data types (classes) that define a blueprint for objects without specifying the implementation details.\n",
    "Abstraction provides a clear separation between the interface (what an object does) and the implementation (how it does it), promoting code reuse, modularity, and flexibility."
